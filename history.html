<b> Establishment and early years
The Maccabi Haifa football club was founded in Haifa in 1913. 
Initially, the Workers' Council team joined the Maccabi Haifa team, but due to friction, they were separated into two teams: "Maccabi" and "Hapoel" Haifa. 
In those years, Maccabi was called "Maccabi the Hero Haifa", until its name was changed to "Maccabi Haifa" in the 1940s and its joining the Maccabi Haifa Association.</b>
